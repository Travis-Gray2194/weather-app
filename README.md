Develop a Weather App using Flutter that provides users with current weather information and forecasts.
This project will focus on integrating weather data from a third-party API and displaying it in an organized
manner.

Requirements:

1. Weather Data Integration:
- Integrate with a weather API such as Open Meteo (https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch current
weather data and forecasts.
- Retrieve and display data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions (e.g.,
sunny, rainy).
- Use a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Scoped Model) to manage the
app's state effectively.
- Demonstrate proper separation of concerns between UI and state management.

2. Location-based Weather:
- Automatically fetch weather data based on the user's location.
- Allow users to manually enter a location to view its weather information.

3. Current Weather Screen:
- Display the current weather conditions for the selected location.
- Include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
- Show an icon or image reflecting the current weather state.

4. Testing:
- Write unit tests for critical functions and widgets.
- Ensure proper functionality of weather data retrieval, component rendering, and error
handling.


Bonus:
1. User Preferences:
- Implement a settings screen to allow users to customize app preferences, such as length of
forecast.
- Include options for setting the default unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
2. Geolocated Search:
- Integrate with a location search API or package. Flutterâ€™s package repository (pub.dev) has a
number of free OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps location search packages available
3. Hourly and/or Daily Forecast:
- Provide an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours.
- Display temperature, conditions, and any relevant information in an organized manner.
- Present a 5-day weather forecast with high and low temperatures, conditions, and an icon
representing each day.


Evaluation Criteria:
- Code organization and structure.
- Proper use of Flutter widgets and state management.
- Implementation of core features.
- Testing coverage and effectiveness.
- Bonus points for additional features and clean, maintainable code.

## Framework: Flutter

### Features:

**Multi-flavor support**: development, staging, production
**Platform compatibility**: Android & iOS
**Clean Architecture structure**

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Project Setup
 Create an .env file in the root directory by referring to the provided example [here](env.example). Ensure that you generate the necessary environment variables as specified in the example to enable the usage of all available configurations as listed below.
 
 - .env

### Install dependencies
```sh
flutter pub get
```

alternatively

```sh
make get
```

### Code Generation 
```sh
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Or run the following command to install dependencies and generate codes

```sh
 make fresh
```

### Run the app
 The application consists of 3 different variations, and you can utilize the subsequent commands to execute each distinct variation.

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Chorus works on iOS and Android._

---

## Running Tests ðŸ§ª

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```
