# Weather


Develop a Weather App using Flutter that provides users with current weather information and forecasts.
This project will focus on integrating weather data from a third-party API and displaying it in an organized
manner.

Requirements:

1. Weather Data Integration:
- Integrate with a weather API such as Open Meteo (https://open-meteo.com/) to fetch current
weather data and forecasts.
- Retrieve and display data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions (e.g.,
sunny, rainy).
- Use a state management solution (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Scoped Model) to manage the
app's state effectively.
- Demonstrate proper separation of concerns between UI and state management.

2. Location-based Weather:
- Automatically fetch weather data based on the user's location.
- Allow users to manually enter a location to view its weather information.

3. Current Weather Screen:
- Display the current weather conditions for the selected location.
- Include details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
- Show an icon or image reflecting the current weather state.

4. Testing:
- Write unit tests for critical functions and widgets.
- Ensure proper functionality of weather data retrieval, component rendering, and error
handling.


Bonus:
1. User Preferences:
- Implement a settings screen to allow users to customize app preferences, such as length of
forecast.
- Include options for setting the default unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
2. Geolocated Search:
- Integrate with a location search API or package. Flutter’s package repository (pub.dev) has a
number of free OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps location search packages available
3. Hourly and/or Daily Forecast:
- Provide an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours.
- Display temperature, conditions, and any relevant information in an organized manner.
- Present a 5-day weather forecast with high and low temperatures, conditions, and an icon
representing each day.


Evaluation Criteria:
- Code organization and structure.
- Proper use of Flutter widgets and state management.
- Implementation of core features.
- Testing coverage and effectiveness.
- Bonus points for additional features and clean, maintainable code.

## Getting Started 🚀

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Weather works on iOS, Android, Web, and Windows._

---

## Running Tests 🧪

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations 🌐

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:weather/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
├── l10n
│   ├── arb
│   │   ├── app_en.arb
│   │   └── app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la página del contador"
    }
}
```

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.
